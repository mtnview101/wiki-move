# Downloading Binaries

There are binaries available to [download](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list). These require no other installation steps other than being placed (along with their dependencies) on your CLASSPATH.

If you would like to be kept up to date with developments, want to know when binary packages are released or need any help, please consider joining the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/webdriver). There are links to both the downloads and mailing list from the home page of the project.

# Getting the Latest WebDriver code

In order to get the latest version of the code, please follow the instructions on the project's source page on Google Code located at https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout and clone `https://code.google.com/p/selenium/`. Once you've downloaded the source, please take a look at BuildingWebDriver for instructions on how to compile everything and at the DeveloperTips for information on how to work on the code.

# Building the code

Because of the breadth of languages supported, and the range of technologies used, selenium uses the CrazyFunBuild system. If you're going to build from source, it is recommended you visit the CrazyFunBuild page for more instructions.
